# Invisible Door: Actionpoint Trauma, Inc. Kickers  
**IDApTIK: If you have to ask, you're already compromised.**  

*"Breaking in is easy. Getting back out is harder. Especially when your escape route depends on a hacker who swears he knows what heâ€™s doing, right up until he accidentally reboots the entire security grid. If you live, congratulationsâ€”you have an excellent sense of timing."*  

## ðŸŽ­ What is it?

## ðŸ”¥ Asymmetric Multiplayer  
One player infiltrates. One player hacks. **Neither wins alone.**  
The infiltrator sneaks, jumps, and navigates obstacles.  
The hacker rewires security systems, manipulates doors, and controls the battlefield.  
The problem? **Coordination is everythingâ€”and the hacker is rarely on time.**
